              <li>th</li>
              <li>td</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Article</h3>
          <p>The content of article tags are self-contained and idependent.</p>
          <p> An article should have its own meaning and be easily differentiated from the rest of the web page content. </p>

          <p>The main advantage of the section tag is, it is a semantic element, which describes its meaning to both browser and developer. </p>

          <h3>Aside</h3>
          <p>The aside tag is used to describe the main object of the web page in a shorter way like a highlighter.</p>
          <p> It basically identifies the content that is related to the primary content of the web page but does not constitute the main intent of the primary page.</p>
          <p>The aside tag contains mainly-</p>
          <ul>
              <li>author information</li>
              <li>links </li>
              <li>related content</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Time</h3>
          <p>The time tag is mainly used to display the human readable date or time.</p>
          <p>The main benefit of time tag is that they can offer to add birthday reminders or scheduled events.</p>
          <p> The time element isn’t particularly useful until paired with a datetime attribute. </p> <p>One a datetime attribute has been associated with the time element, the browser knows a lot more about the time described in the time element and can use that information when interacting with other applications — such as when importing information from an HTML email or webpage into a calendar application.</p>

      <h2>Forming a new habit</h2>
        <p>Dr. Maltz found that it would take a patient about 21 days to get adjusted to the new situation.</p> <p>This all forced dr. maltz to think about his own adjustment period to new behaviour and noticed that he was also taking nearly 21 days to form a new habit.</p> <p>Many people tried and chose habits like drinking a bottle of water with lunch or running for 15 minutes before dinner. </p> <p>At the end of 12 weeks ,the researchers analysed the data to determine how long it took each person to go from starting a new behaviour to automatically doing it.</p>
        <p>First, make a decision. Decide clearly that you are going to begin acting in a specific way 100% of the time, whenever that behavior is required.</p> <p>For example, if you decide to arise early and exercise each morning, set your clock for a specific time, and when the alarm goes off, immediately get up, put on your exercise clothes and begin your exercise session.</p>
        <p>Second, never allow an exception to your new habit pattern during the formative stages. Don’t make excuses or rationalizations. Don’t let yourself off the hook.</p> <p>If you resolve to get up at 6:00 AM each morning, discipline yourself to get up at 6:00 AM, every single morning until this becomes automatic. </p>
       
     <p>Third, tell others that you are going to begin practicing a particular behavior.</p> <p> It is amazing how much more disciplined and determined you will become when you know that others are watching you to see if you have the willpower to follow through on your resolution.</p>
     <p> Fourth, visualize yourself performing or behaving in a particular way in a particular situation.</p>  <p>The more often you visualize and imagine yourself acting as if you already had the new habit, the more rapidly this new behavior will be accepted by your subconscious mind and become automatic.</p>
